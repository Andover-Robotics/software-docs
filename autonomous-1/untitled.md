# The Autonomous Period

Each match in FTC starts with the **Autonomous period**, in which the robot has to operate on entirely pre-programmed instructions to complete certain objectives. This portion of the game lasts 30 seconds. Objectives often include:

* Ways the robot can start the game \(like descending from a game element\)
* Sensing game elements and performing actions based on their color
* Deploying a _Team Scoring Element_
* Moving the robot to a certain location

Even though the Autonomous period is only 30 seconds, it is one of the most important parts of the game, so being able to complete autonomous objectives shouldn't be overlooked during the design process.
