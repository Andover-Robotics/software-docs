# The Autonomous Period

Each match starts with the autonomous period, in which the robot has to operate on entirely pre-programmed instructions to complete certain objectives. This portion of the game lasts for 30 seconds. Objectives often include:

+ Ways the robot can start the game (like descending from a game element)
+ Sensing objectives
+ A team marker objective (a team marker is a little object that displays the team number, and you often get points for putting it in a certain place on the field)
+ Moving the robot to a certain location

Even though the autonomous period is only 30 seconds, it is one of the most important parts of the game, and ability to complete autonomous objectives shouldn't be overlooked during the design process.
