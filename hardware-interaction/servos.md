# Servos

Servos are rotating motors that can turn parts within a semicircular range. (For more specific information, ask a member of the build team and/or go here: https://www.servocity.com/what-is-a-servo)

To program servos, the first thing you need to do is to import the Servo class, using this command:

import com.qualcomm.robotcore.hardware.Servo;
