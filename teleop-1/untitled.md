# The TeleOp Period

After the autonomous period (where the robot must operate entirely on preprogrammed instructions), the TeleOp period, in which the drive team can control the robot using gamepads, begins and continues until the end of the match. Typically, an Iterative OpMode is used for TeleOp because it divides the code into five methods, described in the OpMode vs Linear OpMode section, which are called in more contextual ways than the ordered structure of the Linear OpMode.

Typically in FTC games, there is a "scoring" aspect to TeleOp, usually sort of like like a sports game -- achieve the same objective (like placing a given type of object into a designated area) as many times as possible to score more points. For the first minute and thirty seconds of TeleOp, all the robot will do is work with their alliance partner to score as many points as possible using that mechanism. However, the last 30 seconds are what is known as the endgame.

## The Endgame

During the final half minute known as the endgame,, we have opportunities to complete specific objectives to earn extra points. These objectives revolve around the way the robot finishes the game (like parking in a specific area or hanging off of a game element).
