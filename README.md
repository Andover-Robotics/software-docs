Welcome to FTC programming! Coding for this robotics competition is an arduous, transformative, and rewarding endeavor that will bring your critical thinking, engineering, and problem solving skills to the next level. The process requires dedication and perseverance, but the end result of a working, competitive robot will bring you immense satisfaction. From collaborative engineering to advanced control theory, programming for FTC gives you a preview of the professional industry of innovative robotics and how your existing knowledge of programming applies to the physical world.

This online guide serves as a parallel resource to the lessons that the Chief Software Officers host during club meetings. The lessons complement this guide by demonstrating the presented concepts using examples on real hardware.

This guide is also meant to be referenced frequently during the competition season. It includes many takeaways from the club's past mistakes that help you troubleshoot your code. It identifies some of the principles and priorities that your code should follow. It explains the social implications of programming for FTC, including the phenomena of working with a team of mostly hardware specialists. To summarize, it prepares you to produce competitive, reliable, maintainable code for a FTC robot.

Ready to get started? Let us introduce you to the FTC Control System.
